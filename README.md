# Paywise
paywise is an smart ledger app that helps you to remember your future transactions by sending personalize notifications so, you don't miss any due dates.
##💡 Inspiration
It's so hard to remember all future transactions in mind and the traditional way of recording it using notebook and pen doesn't remind us automatically on due dates, so I build this smart ledger app.

## 💻 What it does
it sends personalize notifications on due dates to remind you for your transactions so, you can clear them and maintain your credit worthness.

features----
-> complete authentication.
-> create ledger of credit/debit.
-> app will automatically send personalize notifications.
-> focus on scalability of app with pagination rendering.
